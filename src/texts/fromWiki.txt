Lua originated in 1993 as a language for extending software applications to 
meet the increasing demand for customization at the time. It provided the basic facilities 
of most procedural programming languages, but more complicated or domain-specific 
features were not included; rather, it included mechanisms for extending the language, 
allowing programmers to implement such features. As Lua was intended to be a general 
embeddable extension language, the designers of Lua focused on improving its speed, portability, 
extensibility and ease-of-use in development.
